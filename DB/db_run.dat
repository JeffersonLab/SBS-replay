# The minimal required information in this file (for now) is the beam energy and
# the spectrometer central angles and central momenta:

ebeam = 1.916

# as far as I can see only central angle and central momentum are required run parameters
# for THaSpectrometer
# note that pcentral is meaningless for SBS and BB, but as far as I know they are required for
# THaSpectrometer, so I just set them to the momentum of elastically scattered electrons (protons) for
# BB (SBS) respectively
