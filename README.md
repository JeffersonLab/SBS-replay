# SBS-replay

Database files, replay scripts, and analysis/calibration scripts for SBS data analysis.

This repository will be the "official" version control/management for the SBS replay database going forward.

Broadly speaking, database files go under "DB/", replay scripts (configuring and running the analyzer) go under "replay/" and calibration/analysis scripts that do further post-processing
on the analyzer's ROOT output files should be kept under "scripts"

There are no cmake files, and there is no "build" process.
